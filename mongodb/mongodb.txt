What is mongodb?
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON-like format. It is a document
oriented database, which means that it stores data in the form of documents, where each document 
represents a single entity or object.

Mongodb stores data in the form of collection and documents
And each document is the description of the entity (object)'
Collections is a group of documents and multiple collections make up a database

Aggregation function in mongodb
The aggregation framework in MongoDB is a powerful tool for data processing and analysis. 
It allows you to perform complex data processing tasks on large datasets in a flexible and 
efficient way.
----------------------------------------------
Aggregation pipeline
The aggregation pipeline is a series of stages that are applied to the input data to produce the output data
The pipeline consists of several stages, including $match, $project, $group, $sort,
$limit, $skip, $unwind, $lookup, $addFields, $set,
$unset, $replaceWith, $redact, $mergeObjects, $arrayElemAt,
The output of one stage becomes the input of the other stage
-----------------------------------------------
Stages of aggregation pipeline
1. $match: This stage filters the documents to include only those that match a specified condition.
2. $project: This stage selects the fields to include in the output documents.
3. $group: This stage groups the documents by a specified field and applies an aggregation operation to
each group.
4. $sort: This stage sorts the documents in ascending or descending order based on a specified field
5. $limit: This stage limits the number of documents in the output.
6. $skip: This stage skips a specified number of documents in the output.
7. $unwind: This stage transforms an array field into separate documents.
8. $lookup: This stage performs a left outer join with a collection ie Try to lookinto the 
foreign collection based on the specific field
