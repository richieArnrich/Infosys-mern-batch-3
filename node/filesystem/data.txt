Kyle had a few good days before we found out he was a no-good, lying, cheating, sack 
of you-know-what. “Twelve days,” Mei cried, sprawled on my bedroom carpet like a collapsed Jenga 
tower. “Right before our two-week anniversary.” Zoe handed her a yellow pre-strawed Capri Sun, 
but Mei swatted it away. She was in mourning. “He told me I was special,” she wailed. “He gave 
me thaaat.” Without even looking up,The room is unfamiliar. I don't know how I got here. But I know it to be a prison cell, 
cold and dank.I remember that the Praesidium of Magistrates say I am to die. They say I killed a man, 
that I am a murderer. Maybe these things are true, but they are only part of the truth.
